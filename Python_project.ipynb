            "**Description for the Illustration:**\n",
            "1. **Setting:** The scene is set in a spacious, elongated underground subway tunnel that has been vividly transformed into a vertical farm. The curved ceilings of the tunnel and the tracks are still slightly visible, merging historical architecture with futuristic farming techniques.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Foreground:** A focal point in the foreground features several large, vertical hydroponic farming units full of vibrant green leafy vegetables and herbs. Bright LED lights hang above each unit, casting a gentle, artificial sunlight that nurtures the plants.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Characters:** In the midst of the farms, a diverse group of workers (men and women, varying ages and ethnicities) tend to the plants. One worker, a young woman, is checking the hydroponic system, another, an older man, is harvesting greens. They wear casual, modern gardening attire with aprons and gloves.\n",
            "\n",
